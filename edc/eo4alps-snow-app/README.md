# EO4Alps-Snow OGC layer browser

A browser for viewing and downloading snow maps produced by MobyGIS and Eurac research, in the context of the EO4Alps-Snow project funded by ESA. 

The eo4alps snow project is based on a hybrid technology that merges the advantages of the physical model with high-resolution high-frequency Earth Observation snow products. 

By combining the latest technology in snow monitoring, we want to improve the temporal and spatial aggregation of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) monitoring techniques and provide a service of high-resolution SWE monitoring in quasi-real time at Alpine scale. 

## Resources
In the app you can explore the daily snow maps (SWE, Snowdepth) in all the Alps and in the past winter seasons.

It is also possible to select an area of interest and download the raw snow data in GeoTIFF format, in order to be displayed or analyzed in a GIS environment.

Finally, a service is available that calculates for a selected area some snow statistics that are reported in a pdf report generated on the fly.
